{"name":"Vigu","body":"[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/localgod/Vigu.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/localgod/Vigu)\r\n\r\nVigu\r\n====\r\n\r\n*Authors* [Jens Riisom Schultz](mailto:ibber_of_crew42@hotmail.com), [Johannes Skov Frandsen](mailto:localgod@heaven.dk)\r\n*Since*   2012-03-20\r\n\r\nVigu is a PHP error aggregation system, which collects all possible PHP errors and aggregates them in a Redis database. It includes a frontend to browse the data.\r\n\r\nThis project is based on [Zaphod](https://github.com/Ibmurai/zaphod) and depends on several other projects:\r\n  * [Redis](http://redis.io) \r\n  * [The Frood VC framework](https://github.com/Ibmurai/frood)\r\n  * [FroodTwig](https://github.com/Ibmurai/froodTwig)\r\n  * [PHP-Daemon](https://github.com/shaneharter/PHP-Daemon)\r\n  * [Jquery](http://jquery.com/)\r\n  * [jqGrid](http://www.trirand.com/blog/)\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n  * You need apache mod_rewrite.\r\n  * You need the `pecl_http` PHP extension.\r\n  * You need the [`phpredis`](https://github.com/nicolasff/phpredis) PHP extension.\r\n  * You need a Redis server, dedicated to this application.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n  * Point your browser to the root of the site, to start browsing errors.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstalling\r\n----------\r\n\r\n  * Clone vigu from git.\r\n  * Run `install.php` from command line.\r\n  * Copy `vigu.ini.dist` to `vigu.ini` and edit it.\r\n  * Make a vhost, to point at the root of vigu or the `web/` folder, or however you choose to serve the site.\r\n  * Copy `vigu.ini` to `handlers/vigu.ini`.\r\n  * Include `handlers/shutdown.php` before anything else, preferably through php.ini's `auto_prepend_file` directive. It has no dependencies besides it's configuration file, which must exist next to it, so you can safely deploy it alone, to all your servers.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCopyright 2012 Jens Riisom Schultz, Johannes Skov Frandsen\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n","tagline":"Error aggregation application written in and for Php","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
